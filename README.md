#  Decoding Vehicle Theft Trends in New Zealand


This project is my Insight In the landscape of New Zealand's automotive domain, understanding and mitigating vehicle theft is paramount. As a dedicated Data Analyst, I've delved into the intricate data surrounding this issue, applying advanced analytics to unveil insights that can reshape strategies and safeguard our vehicles.

The project is based on stolen vehicle data from the New Zealand police department's vehicle of interest database containing 6 months of data. Each record represents a single stolen vehicle, with data on vehicle type, make, year, color, date stolen and region stolen.

## General Overview:


### Geospatial Analysis: 
Leveraging [Technical Tools] such as SQL, Excel, and Power BI, I conducted a comprehensive geospatial analysis to identify hotspots of vehicle theft across New Zealand's regions.

### Temporal Patterns:
 Through [Data Analysis Skills], I deciphered temporal patterns in theft occurrences, shedding light on peak times and seasons. This information is crucial for law enforcement and security measures.

### Vehicle Models at Risk:
 Applying [Predictive Modeling] techniques, I assessed the vulnerability of different vehicle models to theft. This insight can guide owners and insurers in making informed decisions.

### Achievements: 
Developed dynamic dashboards for law enforcement agencies giving them platform to curb and response to vehicle theft incidents.

## Key insights:
The comprehensive insight is based on
vehicle theft in New Zealand between
07/10/2021 and 06/04/2022. (6 months).
The dataset was collected from New
Zealand police department via Maven
analytics.


 -  Auckland is the hot spot for theft with over a third of the nation's stolen cars occurring in or around the super city. Auckland reported far higher cases of vehicle theft claims with 1638 within 6 months. Itâ€™s well above runner-up Canterbury, which reported 660 claims.

 -  Cars manufactured in 2005 were the subject of the most theft Cars without advanced security features such as keyless ignitions, immobilisers, or alarms, or parked where a swift getaway is possible, have a higher risk of being stolen.

 -  While the Toyota Hilux may be the car most stolen nationwide, in Auckland thieves clearly have a different taste, with Nissan Tiida and Toyota Aqua taking the lead.

 -  Saloon and Station wagon models consistently lead thefts across regions, suggestion a region wide market demand.

 -  There is a positive correlation between vehicle theft and population size, suggesting that area with larger populations experience more theft.

 -  Vehicles with silver colour are the most stolen possibly because sliver is common. While pink vehicles are the least stolen.
